These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and are not modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb's effect. The addition of the bracket serves to unbalance the weapon, reducing its range to 30 feet. It otherwise functions as a crossbow (when determining damage, reload, and so on).

When worn with a breastplate, chain shirt, chain mail, or scale mail, an armored skirt increases the armor's item bonus to AC by 1, worsens the armor's check penalty by 1, reduces the armor's Dex cap by 1, increases the Strength score required to ignore the check penalty and reduce the Speed penalty by 2, and adds the noisy trait. This also makes the armor one step heavier (from light to medium, or medium to heavy), and you use the proficiency bonus appropriate to this adjusted armor type. Alternatively, when wearing an armored skirt to replace appropriate portions of a set of half plate or full plate, reduce the armor's item bonus to AC by 1, lessen the check penalty by 1, decrease the Strength score required to ignore the check penalty and reduce the Speed penalty by 2, increase the armor's Dex cap by 1, and add the noisy trait to the armor.

If you spend 1 minute referencing an academic journal before attempting a skill check to Recall Knowledge about the subject, you gain a +1 item bonus to the check. A compendium of journals costs five times as much as a single journal and requires both hands to use; each compendium contains several journals and grants its bonus on a broader topic, such as all undead or a whole city. The GM determines what scholarly journals are available in any location. Numerous volumes and editions of the Pathfinder Chronicles exist, each cataloging different adventures. Pathfinder Chronicles are a type of scholarly journal that specifically devotes topics to Pathfinder discoveries, rather than more theoretical academic topics. Because Pathfinders have better access to these chronicles than other scholarly journals, they are particularly common among Pathfinder agents building a library of reference texts.",

When imbibed, you take the shape of a humanoid creature of your size, but different enough so you might be unrecognizable. If you aren't a humanoid, you might take on a form more similar to your own, at the GM's discretion. The creator of the elixir decides the basics of the appearance you transform into when you imbibe the elixir, including eye color, skin tone, and hair color. The elixir can't change your form into that of a specific person. After the form takes hold, you retain it for the next 10 minutes. Drinking this elixir counts as setting up a disguise to Impersonate. You gain a +4 status bonus to your Deception DC to avoid others seeing through your disguise, and you add your level to this DC even if untrained."
